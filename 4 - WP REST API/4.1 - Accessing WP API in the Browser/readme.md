# 4.1 - Accessing the WP REST API in the Browser

This exercise helps you get comfortable with the basic URL structure of the WordPress REST API

1. Access yoursite.com/wp-json/ (You should see the WP API Root for your site)
2. Access yoursite.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/1 (You should see a single post.  If not, use an ID of a post that does exist)
3. Access yoursite.com/wp-json/wp/v2/pages (You should see an array of pages)
4. Play around with accessing other routes in the browser (ie media, users, categories, tags, etc)
